# Active Context: Knowledge Workspace Platform

## Current Work Focus

### Phase: Project Initialization & Memory Bank Setup
**Status**: In Progress  
**Started**: 2025-06-30  
**Priority**: High

Currently establishing the foundational documentation and project structure for the Knowledge Workspace Platform. This phase focuses on creating the Memory Bank system and scaffolding the core application architecture.

## Recent Changes

### Memory Bank Documentation (Completed)
1. **projectbrief.md** - Established core project vision and requirements
2. **productContext.md** - Defined user experience goals and market positioning  
3. **systemPatterns.md** - Architected technical patterns and data models
4. **techContext.md** - Specified technology stack and development environment

### Next Immediate Steps
1. **activeContext.md** - Document current work state (this file)
2. **progress.md** - Track implementation status and milestones
3. **Project Structure** - Create backend and frontend scaffolding
4. **Development Environment** - Set up Docker Compose and local development

## Active Decisions & Considerations

### Technology Choices Made
- **Backend**: FastAPI + Supabase (self-hosted PostgreSQL)
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14+ with App Router + TypeScript
- **Editor**: ProseMirror with Y.js for collaboration
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom component library
- **State Management**: Zustand + TanStack Query
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth with JWT + RLS

### Architecture Decisions
- **Multi-tenancy**: Organization-based with Row Level Security
- **Document Structure**: Hierarchical (Org → Projects → Documents)
- **AI Integration**: Agent registry with capability-based permissions
- **Real-time Collaboration**: WebSocket + Operational Transformation

### Pending Decisions
- **AI Provider**: Which LLM service to integrate first (OpenAI, Anthropic, local)
- **Deployment**: Docker Swarm vs Kubernetes for production
- **Monitoring**: Specific observability stack (Prometheus, Grafana, etc.)
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions vs GitLab CI pipeline setup

## Important Patterns & Preferences

### Development Patterns
- **API-First Design**: OpenAPI documentation drives development
- **Type Safety**: Strict TypeScript + Pydantic validation
- **Security by Default**: RLS policies + input validation everywhere
- **Test-Driven**: Unit tests for business logic, integration tests for APIs

### Code Organization
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between API, business logic, and data layers
- **Dependency Injection**: FastAPI dependencies for clean architecture
- **Component Composition**: React components built with Radix UI primitives
- **Configuration Management**: Environment-based settings with validation

### User Experience Principles
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works without JavaScript
- **Accessibility First**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance from the start
- **Performance**: Sub-200ms API responses, optimistic UI updates
- **Collaboration**: Real-time features that don't interfere with individual work

## Learnings & Project Insights

### Key Insights from Planning Phase
1. **Memory Bank System**: The structured documentation approach is crucial for maintaining context across sessions - this should be a core differentiator
2. **Multi-tenancy Complexity**: RLS provides elegant data isolation but requires careful query optimization
3. **AI Integration Strategy**: Starting with document analysis and content suggestions before moving to complex agents
4. **Editor Requirements**: ProseMirror's flexibility is essential for structured content + real-time collaboration

### Technical Considerations
- **Database Design**: JSONB for document content provides flexibility while maintaining queryability
- **Real-time Architecture**: WebSocket connections need careful management for scalability
- **AI Context Management**: Document context needs to be efficiently passed to AI agents
- **Security Model**: JWT claims + RLS policies provide robust multi-tenant security

### Product Strategy Insights
- **Target Market**: Developer teams are the primary market, but the platform should be accessible to non-technical knowledge workers
- **Feature Prioritization**: Core document management + basic AI assistance before advanced collaboration features
- **Monetization**: Usage-based pricing for AI features, seat-based for collaboration

## Current Blockers & Risks

### Technical Risks
- **ProseMirror Complexity**: Rich text editor integration may be more complex than anticipated
- **Real-time Scaling**: WebSocket connection management at scale
- **AI Integration**: Rate limiting and cost management for AI API calls

### Product Risks
- **Market Fit**: Balancing developer-focused features with broader knowledge worker appeal
- **Feature Scope**: Risk of building too many features before validating core value proposition

### Mitigation Strategies
- **MVP Focus**: Start with core document management, add AI features incrementally
- **Performance Testing**: Load testing for real-time features early in development
- **User Feedback**: Early beta testing with target developer teams

## Team Context & Collaboration

### Current Team Structure
- **Solo Development**: Currently single developer (bootstrapping phase)
- **Future Hiring**: Plan to add frontend specialist and DevOps engineer

### Communication Patterns
- **Documentation First**: All decisions documented in Memory Bank
- **Async by Default**: Detailed written communication over meetings
- **Context Preservation**: Memory Bank system ensures knowledge transfer

### Development Workflow
- **Feature Branches**: Git flow with feature branches and pull requests
- **Code Review**: Self-review initially, peer review when team grows
- **Deployment**: Automated CI/CD pipeline with staging environment

## Success Metrics & Goals

### Short-term Goals (Next 2 weeks)
- [ ] Complete Memory Bank documentation
- [ ] Set up project structure (backend + frontend)
- [ ] Configure local development environment
- [ ] Implement basic authentication flow
- [ ] Create initial database schema

### Medium-term Goals (Next 6 weeks)
- [ ] Core document CRUD operations
- [ ] Basic ProseMirror editor integration
- [ ] Multi-tenant organization management
- [ ] Simple AI content suggestions
- [ ] Real-time collaboration prototype

### Success Indicators
- **Development Velocity**: Consistent daily progress on core features
- **Code Quality**: High test coverage and type safety
- **Documentation**: Up-to-date Memory Bank reflecting current state
- **User Experience**: Smooth onboarding and core workflows

This active context will be updated regularly to reflect the current state of development and key decisions being made.
