## Known Issues

### Current Blockers
*None at this stage - ready to begin implementation*

### Technical Debt
*None yet - starting with clean architecture*

### Performance Concerns
*To be monitored as implementation progresses*

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Decisions (2025-06-30)
- **Architecture**: Multi-tenant SaaS with organization-based isolation
- **Technology Stack**: FastAPI + Next.js + Supabase
- **Editor Strategy**: ProseMirror for rich text with real-time collaboration
- **AI Integration**: Agent-based system with capability permissions

### Decision Changes
*No changes yet - initial architecture decisions*

### Lessons Learned
1. **Documentation First**: Starting with comprehensive Memory Bank documentation provides clear direction
2. **Architecture Planning**: Upfront system design prevents major refactoring later
3. **Technology Selection**: Choosing proven, well-integrated technologies reduces risk
4. **Scope Management**: Clear milestone definition helps maintain focus

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Items
- **ProseMirror Complexity**: Rich text editor integration may require significant time investment
- **Real-time Scaling**: WebSocket management and operational transformation complexity
- **AI Integration**: Managing costs and rate limits for AI API calls

### Medium Risk Items
- **Multi-tenancy**: Ensuring proper data isolation and performance
- **User Experience**: Balancing feature richness with simplicity
- **Market Validation**: Confirming product-market fit with target users

### Low Risk Items
- **Basic CRUD Operations**: Standard web application patterns
- **Authentication**: Well-established Supabase Auth integration
- **Database Design**: PostgreSQL with proven patterns

## Success Metrics

### Development Metrics
- **Velocity**: Target 5-10 story points per week
- **Quality**: >90% test coverage for business logic
- **Performance**: <200ms API response times
- **Reliability**: >99% uptime for core features

### Product Metrics
- **User Engagement**: Daily active users per organization
- **Feature Adoption**: Usage of AI assistance features
- **Collaboration**: Real-time editing sessions per day
- **Retention**: Weekly active user retention rate

### Business Metrics
- **Customer Acquisition**: Organizations onboarded per month
- **Revenue**: Monthly recurring revenue growth
- **Expansion**: Users per organization growth
- **Satisfaction**: Net Promoter Score (NPS)
